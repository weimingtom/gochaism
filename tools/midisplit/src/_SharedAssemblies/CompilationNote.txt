MidiSplit uses MIDI.NET C# library
http://midinet.codeplex.com/

I encountered a few problems of MIDI.NET during the development of MidiSplit.
Therefore, I modified the library source code, and recompiled them.
Changes are written in *.patch file. They are small, but important.

How to build MIDI.NET is explained in VST.NET wiki page.
http://vstnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Building%20the%20Source%20Code
VST.NET is another project by the author of MIDI.NET.
Both they have similar structure, and the explanation is adaptable to MIDI.NET.
